## The primary goal of this study is: 

to focus on the relationship between the environment and climate change by combining social network analysis (SNA) of climate change with sentiment analysis. 

## Some of the objectives to be covered are:
 
i)	create social network graphs to distinguish communities and determine how various groups interact with influencers\
ii)	detect color-node communities by using the modularity algorithm\
iii) analyze text on social networks\
iv)	apply the forceatlas2 algorithm in order to spatialize social networks
